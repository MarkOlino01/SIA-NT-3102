# Expectations in System Integration and Architecture

Hello sir, I'm Mark Lee Olino from BSIT-NT 3102,To be honest sir, I really have no idea about System Integration and Architecture, which is why I don't know what to study and the content of this subject, but once we start studying System Integration and Architecture, I anticipate learning more about how various system elements interact to produce a comprehensive and effective solution.  The fundamentals of system design, the function of architecture in guaranteeing scalability and dependability, and how integration permits smooth communication between hardware and software are all topics I am keen to learn more about.  I'm also excited to investigate real-world applications because this field will enable me to relate theory to practical applications.

Increasing my technical proficiency in system architecture analysis and design is another goal I have.  This subject, in my opinion, will force me to consider compatibility, performance, and security while integrating various systems from a critical standpoint.  In order to be ready to participate successfully in upcoming projects or professional contexts, I also hope to obtain practical expertise with technologies and approaches that are frequently utilized in the field.

Finally, I anticipate that this course will aid in the development of my problem-solving and teamwork abilities.  I expect that we will come across group projects or activities that mimic real-world situations because system integration frequently entails working with several teams and technologies.  By doing this, I intend to improve my capacity for clear concept communication, integrated problem solving, and creative solution suggestion.  All things considered, I anticipate that System Integration and Architecture will be rewarding and difficult, providing me with useful knowledge that I may use in my future profession.
