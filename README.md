# Expectations in System Integration and Architecture

As I begin studying System Integration and Architecture, I expect to gain a deeper understanding of how different components of a system work together to create a complete and efficient solution. I am eager to learn about the principles behind system design, the role of architecture in ensuring scalability and reliability, and how integration enables seamless communication between software and hardware. I also look forward to exploring practical applications, as this subject will allow me to connect theories with real-world implementations.

Another expectation I have is to develop my technical skills in analyzing and designing system architectures. I believe this subject will challenge me to think critically about issues such as compatibility, performance, and security when integrating multiple systems. I also expect to gain hands-on experience with tools and methodologies that are commonly used in the industry, which will prepare me to contribute effectively in future projects or professional settings.

Lastly, I expect that this subject will help me build collaboration and problem-solving skills. Since system integration often involves working with different technologies and teams, I anticipate that we will encounter group activities or projects that simulate real-world scenarios. Through this, I hope to strengthen my ability to communicate ideas clearly, troubleshoot integration issues, and propose innovative solutions. Overall, I expect System Integration and Architecture to be both challenging and rewarding, giving me valuable knowledge that I can apply in my future career.
